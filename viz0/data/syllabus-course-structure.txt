### Class structure

There are seven session in each class. Each includes videos, individual assignments, and discussion/activities that are related to the topic and are completed either individually, within pairs, or within small groups of students. You will be given one week for each sessions (a half week during summer session). In the final week, you will produce a data visualization using an independent data set and defend the choices you made in that visualization.
