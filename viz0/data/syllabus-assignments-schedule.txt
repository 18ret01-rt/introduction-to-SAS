### Schedule

This class consists of seven modules plus a final project. This is not a self-paced class. Modules will be released roughly once per week and you will have two weeks from the release date to complete all work in that module. In the summer session, two modules will be released per week and you will have one week from the release date to complete all work in that module.

The final project will be due in week 10 of the semester (week 5 during the summer session). Specific due dates for all work will be posted on Canvas.

Assignments that are completed late will be subject to a 50% penalty, with no exceptions unless you receive prior written permission from the instructor. Students who fail to make adequate progress by the end of the sixth week of class (third week during the summer session) will be asked to drop the class.
