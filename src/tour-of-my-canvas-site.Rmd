<div class="notes">

In the following video, I will illustrate various requirements for my assignment.

Please note that I will rely mostly on screen shots of my Canvas site organized into an html presentation. It's easier for me than a live presentation and more closely mimics how I will do other videos for my online class.

Let me offer two warnings of things I have not quite gotten to, but intend to fix as soon as possible. 

The current incarnation of the html presentation does not have alt text for my images, so I will place the alt text beneath the images for now. I also need to use descriptive text for many of my URLs.

Let me know if you need these fixed prior to certifying my successful completion of this assignment.

To keep this video short, I won't read most of the contents of each slide. In a real class video, I would certainly take the time to do this properly.
