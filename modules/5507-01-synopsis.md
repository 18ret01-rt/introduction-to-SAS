### Module01-Getting started

You should start out slowly. There is a very small SAS program that I show. See if you can copy the program (changing my name to your name) and get it to run. If it runs, try adding a documentation header. Then see if you can store the data in a permanent location. See if you can store the output as a PDF file. Finally, see if you can move the data to a separate location.

**Although I am giving you a lot of time, please don't delay on this first homework assignment. Getting a program to run--any program can be the hardest part of this class. Everything is new and there are a lot of subtle details that are easy to overlook. Try your best, but if you can't get the basic program to work, set up an appointment to talk to me.**
