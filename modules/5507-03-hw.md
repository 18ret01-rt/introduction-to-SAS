Homework03.

Q1. The file [energy01.csv][git1a] is a comma delimited file. Details about this file are in its [data dictionary][git1b]. Read this file into SAS and print the first three rows of data. 

Q2. The file [energy02.tsv][git2a] replaces the commas with tabs as delimiters. Details about this file are in its [data dictionary][git2b]. Read this file into SAS and print the first three rows of data. 

Q3. The file [energy03.txt][git3a] is the same data but uses a fixed width format. Details about this file are in its [data dictionary][git3b]. Read this file into SAS and print the first three rows of data. 

Q4. The file [energy01.csv][git4a] is a comma delimited file, like above, but the variables names are included in the first row of data. Details about this file are in its [data dictionary][git4b]. Read this file into SAS and print the first three rows of data. 

Include your code and your output in a single PDF file. This assignment will use [this grading rubric][git5].


#### Discuss03

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after the deadline.

I'd like some brief feedback to the videos you just watched. Keep it short. One or two sentences per question is fine. You can also say something briefer like "I agree with [other student]". If you found everything confusing or nothing confusing, just respond with the word "everything" or "nothing." Please don't spend more than a minute on this assignment. I just want a quick reaction.

1. What was the most important thing you learned in these videos?

2. What was the one thing that you found confusing?

3. What would you like to see covered next?

#### Quiz03
