title: "MEDB 5507, Introduction to SAS, Module08, Final project"
---

Your final project, as a reminder, is to take a data set that you have found on your own, import it into SAS and produce a few of the tables and graphs that we have discussed in this class. The actual tables and graphs that you choose will depend on your data set, of course, and anything reasonable is fine. If you have already identified a data set, let me just warn you not to bite off more than you can chew. It is okay to look at a smaller number of rows and few variables, as long as the data is sufficiently complex to allow for a few interesting comparisons. If you have not identified a data set yet, I can help you find one. I know of dozens of different data sources that are free and publicly available.

It's okay if the number of pages in your final project is a bit longer than what I recommended for your earlier assignments.

Here are some elements that you need in your final project.

+ A description of where you found this data.

+ A listing of no more than ten rows and five columns of data.

+ Means, standard deviations, minimum, maximum, and number of missing values for at least two continuous variables.

+ Frequency counts including counts of missing values for at least two categorical variable. You must use value labels (proc format) for these variables if the data are coded as number values or single letter abbreviations.

+ At least one graph showing the relationship between two continuous variables (scatterplot) or between one continuous variable and one categorical variable (boxplot).

+ Feel free to include a few other tables or graphs if you feel they are appropriate. The total number of pages in your report should be ten pages or less.
