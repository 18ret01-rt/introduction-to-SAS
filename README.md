# introduction-to-SAS

This is a series of files used in my course MEDB5507, 
Introduction to SAS. It contains mostly presentation
files in PDF format, but originated using the 
presentation capabilities of RMarkdown. It also has
SAS code and information about data sets using in the
class.

It was run and tested using RStudio and the knitr package.

Use the file with the .Rmd extension as input, or examine the
file with the .pdf extension to see what the output is like.

This application does not need any special files beyond the
ones listed above.
